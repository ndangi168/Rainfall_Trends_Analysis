# Rainfall Forecasting Using Prophet and ARIMA

This project aims to predict future **annual rainfall trends** using a popular time series forecasting models: **Facebook Prophet**. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, prediction visualization using Plotly, and model evaluation.

## Models Used
- **Prophet (developed by Facebook/Meta)**  

## 📈 Visualizations
Interactive plots are generated using **Plotly**, showcasing:
- Historical rainfall trends
- Forecasted rainfall for the next 20 years

## 📦 Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
📌 Notes

This project is part of a broader research and development interest in agricultural analytics. It is indirectly related to the project titled:
“Crop Recommendation and Irrigation System using ML with Integrated IoT”, which involves using machine learning and IoT devices to optimize agricultural decisions.
Although rainfall prediction is not directly embedded in that system, this analysis provides potential value for future integrations, such as improving irrigation timing, estimating water availability, or recommending drought-resilient crops.
